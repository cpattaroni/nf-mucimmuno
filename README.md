# Nextflow Workflows

As they are built and published, this repository will contain Nextflow workflows for processing of different data omic modalities.

Additionally, we may provide additional tools and code for further downstream processing, with the goal of standardising data analytic approaches within the Mucosal Immunology Lab.
