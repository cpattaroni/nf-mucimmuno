Proceeding with single-core trimming (user-defined)
Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.9
single-core operation.
igzip detected. Using igzip for decompressing

No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)



AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> SB_1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	1	AGATCGGAAGAGC	2000	0.05
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	2000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	2000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 1). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 0)
