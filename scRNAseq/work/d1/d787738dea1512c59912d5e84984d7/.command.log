Run 'mamba init' to be able to run mamba activate/deactivate
and start a new shell session. Or use conda to activate/deactivate.

Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.9
single-core operation.

AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> DM_1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	2000	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	2000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	2000	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count Nextera: 0, count Illumina: 0, count smallRNA: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
